# About The Project

As you will see when you run the .py file: This is a simple controller, not meant to be pretty, but useful. I have separated the controllers for the Z axis from the XY plane to decrease the need to keep changing the step size each time you move in the XY plane since the steps taken in the Z axis are usually smaller than the one taken in the XY plane.

The XY controllers and Z controllers are identical. On the left side you have the direction controllers and a CLEAR button (to erase the step size), on the right side you can choose the step size

There is also a Net Z distance traveled logger in the bottom of the window. You also have a CLEAR button for that too if you want to set the zero of you Z axis at any time.

This is open project so do what you want with this code. This code clearly isn't a masterpiece in terms of organization and definetly not Pythonic enough. Feel free to fork it and make it better.
